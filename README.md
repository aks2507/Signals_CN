# Signals_CN
These two are the codes for the question given in class. I have used two shared memories and SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 to manage the signals. To see the output correctly, please open both the programs in separate terminals.
Type in P2 first, after a wait of 2 seconds, when "Me:" pops up
Then you will see that text received in P1
After 2 seconds. type in P1, when "Me:" pops up
Then you will see that text from P1 in P2
and so on
